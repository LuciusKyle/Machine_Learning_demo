# Machine_Learning_demo
This is a simple C++ implementation of neural network for recognition of hand write of numbers.
I learned this from http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/, the author's GitHub: https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning

The performance of my program is bad, it takes more than an hour to finish all the training, while the author's python implementation only takes several minutes.

training data and test data can be downloaded from: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

you should configure the Visual Studio include directory and lib directory to fit your own development environment. matrix oprations are 
relied on Boost(uBLAS) libarary.
